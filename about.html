      <h2>What is href in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        In HTML, the href attribute is indeed used to specify the URL (Uniform
        Resource Locator) of the linked resource, such as another web page, an
        image, or a file. It stands for "Hypertext Reference" and is a standard
        attribute used within the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor) tag to create
        hyperlinks.

    <section id="navTag">
      <h1>Nav Tag</h1>
      <p>
        The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag in HTML is a semantic element that is
        used to define a section of navigation links within a web page. It's
        typically used to contain links that navigate to different pages or
        sections of the current page, such as menus, navigation bars, or lists
        of related links. The purpose of the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element is
        to clearly indicate to both browsers and assistive technologies like
        screen readers that the contained links are intended for navigation
        purposes. This helps improve accessibility and makes it easier for users
        to navigate through the content of the web page.

      <h1>Section Tag</h1>
      <p>
        In HTML, the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element is used to define
        sections or groups of related content within a web page. It's a semantic
        HTML5 element introduced to enhance the structure and meaning of web
        documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (paragraph) element is used
        specifically for paragraphs of text, the
        <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element is more generic and can encompass a
        broader range of content. Here are some common use cases for the
        <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Structural organization:</strong>
          <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> can be used to divide a web page into
          distinct sections, such as an introduction, main content, sidebar,
          footer, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grouping related content:</strong> It's often used to group
          together related content within a larger section of a web page. For
          example, within the main content area, you might have different
          sections for articles, blog posts, or product listings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accessibility and SEO:</strong> Properly using semantic HTML
          elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> helps improve accessibility
          for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.
          It also helps search engines better understand the structure and
          context of your web page, potentially improving SEO (Search Engine
          Optimization).
